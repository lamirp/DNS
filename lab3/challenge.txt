Challenge #1 (up to 5 points): Made the _print function far more readable for users.
Due to length and size, it would be impossible to 'draw' the tree with characters so
we kept running counts of the Level and Index of each node on its level to print. Alert the
user when a new level is entered and a neighbor is the next move.
