Describe how you implemented the main programming assignment. The README
file should describe what you did, what approach you took, results of any
measurements you made, which files are included in your submission and what
they are for, etc.  Feel free to include any other information you think is
helpful to us in this README; it can only help your grade.


Implementation started with the majority of my comments as a skeleton.

I made mysyscall.h for the syscalls and wrapper functions in mysyscall.c I wound up
adding unlink, access, lstat and readdir at the current time in addition to the original six that
were necessary.

Next I made a bunch of helper functions, in myhelpers.c including string length, string compare,
string copy, string memset and ATOF(used double).

After being unable to use getopts due to the lack of stdlib, I created my own op argument catcher
as similar/simple as I could.

I have permission checks when opening/creating/writing files.

I think I was able to efficiently get everything but -r done.
